# ASL Var Viewer

Generic ASL Variable Viewer.

Can read any current/vars variable within the loaded/running ASL script.  Configure in settings with the **Exact** state/variable name from the script running.

TODO:

* Settings Page
  * Better Handling of ASLEngine Connection
  * Hook in Extra Color Settings that are provided into Component
  * Have coloring based on certain parameters?
  * Preview of Vars before Start?
